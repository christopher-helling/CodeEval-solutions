# CodeEval-solutions
A place to store my completed CodeEval problems: https://www.codeeval.com/profile/christopher_helling/

Please do not copy these for use on CodeEval-- I think a few of them are clever. I did most of them in C#, but I plan on doing them again in Java and Python. 

I have ~40 solutions still to upload.
